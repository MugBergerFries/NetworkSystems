This program includes a utfp_client.c and utfp_server.c file, which allow the client to push and pull file to and from the server
Commands:
	put *filename*: Sends a file from the client directory to the server
	get *filename*: Get a file from the server directory
	ls: list all files and subdirectories in the server directory
	delete *filename*: Deletes a file from the server directory
	exit: Shuts the server down and then the client

Note: Filename is expected to be 4 characters. Files with null characters (0x00) commonly behave aberrantly

How to use:
run make clean then make in Assignment1 folder on both server and client machine
start client with ./client *hostname* *port*
on server machine, cd to udp folder, start server with ./server *port*
