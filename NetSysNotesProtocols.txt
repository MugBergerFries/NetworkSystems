hostnames can map to multiple IP addresses
map to different addresses in different places.

Multiple hostnames for same IP
Three Identifiers: Hostname, IP, MAC
	IP: Appreciated by routers, based on location, heirarchichal, 32 bits
	MAC: Appreciated within LAN, Unique, hard-coded in the adapter, Flat name space of 48 bits

DNS: Given a host, provide IP; Given iP, give host
DHCP: Given MAC, assign unique IP; And tell host other LAN info; keep all info to send packets
ARP: Learn mapping between IPs and interface addresses

Key ideas in DHCP and ARP
	Broadcasting (ask by broadcasting)
	Caching (Store info for a bit)
	Soft state (forget after a while)

When device is connected to network, it has no IP and doesn't know how to get it
	Broadcast to discover a server who can help
		Broadcast a DHCP server-discovery message
		Server sends a DHCP "offer" message
	Special destination address for the broadcast: FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF
	All adapters on the LAN get it
	Response from DHCP server
		"offer message" Propose IP, mask, gateway, DNS server, etc
		Lease time (how long the above is valid)
	Multiple servers may respond
		Client can decide between offers
	Client sends a DHCP request broadcasted for the desired offer
	Server sends a DHCP ACK to confirm
Computers usually release their IP on shutdown (ipconfig/release)
Sometimes they don't (crashes)
Every node maintains an ARP table: (IP/MAC pair)
